      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="blurb">A Consulting Forester is an independent natural resource advisor working for the 
        landowner to give advice and counsel on all natural resource matters. The clients we 
        choose to work with feel confident that we always have their best interests in mind. 
        If we do not have the answers, we help the landowners find the answers, even if it 
        means utilizing other Consulting Foresters.</div>
