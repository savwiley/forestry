      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="blurb">A Consulting Forester is an independent natural resource advisor working for the 
        landowner to give advice and counsel on all natural resource matters. The clients we 
        choose to work with feel confident that we always have their best interests in mind. 
        If we do not have the answers, we help the landowners find the answers, even if it 
        means utilizing other Consulting Foresters.</div>

        <p>My husband hired Next Generation Forestry in the spring of 2021 and 
          passed away that December. The following is a brief description of how 
          much I appreciate the services provided by Next Generation Forestry. 
          After my husband's passing, you graciously helped me navigate through 
          the ranch timber operations that were planned. You and your team were 
          invaluable in getting me through that year as I knew little about the 
          process. I trust you implicitly as you have been nothing but honest and 
          reliable in all areas. I will sorely miss your expertise and friendship.</p>

        <p>You approach a harvest project like it is your own, from establishing 
          lucrative harvest boundaries, negotiating great timber prices, getting the 
          right contractors, to finding seedlings to getting the reforestation done. 
          With you there is high confidence that the harvest project will be a 
          success for the landowner.</p>
